    Observation: |-
      The screenshot shows that I am on the Main Page of Outlook. The Main Page has a list of control items and email received. The new email editing window is not opened. The last action took effect by opening the Outlook application.
    Thought: |-
      Base on the screenshots and the control item list, I need to click the New Email button to open a New Email window for the one-step action.
    ControlLabel: |-
      1
    ControlText: |-
      New Email
    Function: |-
      click_input
    Args: 
      {"button": "left", "double": false}
  Tips: |-
    - Sending an email is a sensitive action that needs to be confirmed by the user before the execution.
    - You need to draft the content of the email and send it to the receiver.
